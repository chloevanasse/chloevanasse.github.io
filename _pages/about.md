Welcome to my website! 

I'm a **Ph.D. candidate in Marketing** at HEC Montréal and Lecturer in Marketing at HEC Montréal. I will be on the 2025/2026 academic job market.

My research interests include stakeholder behavior and decision-making, marketing signals and cues, and service performance. Drawing on signaling theory, my doctoral dissertation develops advanced econometric and statistical models to examine how different types of stakeholders—including consumers, shareholders, and information intermediaries—respond over time to a firm's actions and market signals.

I have presented my research at leading marketing conferences and worked closely with multiple industry partners. As part of these collaborations, I have used large-scale real-world datasets to analyze key marketing levers—such as pricing and promotions—and identify sales growth opportunities for my partners.
